Hi! I am Nandom!
I created code because I had a 'git' (LOL)
of problems multiplying.
I started with this:
user=input("what is your name?")
input("what multiplication table do you want")
if input==2
print(2*2)

Then I spiffed it up a bit with a for loop:
user = input("What is your name? ")
table = int(input("What multiplication table do you want? "))   
for x in range(1, 11):
	print(table*x)

 And then I asked ChatGPT to add some GUI amd that's why the code is the eay it is.
 I hope you guyz like it!
 All glory to God!
